Give me answer of these questions for ___ in Java
🌀 1. What It Is (Definition & Purpose)
What is this data structure and why was it created?
What types of problems is it best suited for?
Is it linear/non-linear? Static or dynamic?
How is it laid out in memory? (Contiguous vs Pointers)
Key trade-offs: speed 🆚 flexibility
Are there newer or optimized variants in modern libraries?

🛠️ 2. How It Works (Syntax + Core Ops)
How to create/initialize it in Java?
Core operations: insert, delete, access, search
Syntax for traversal/iteration
Imp and commonly used Built-in methods?
Time & space complexity of core operations
Does it handle memory/resizing automatically?

🧪 3. Use Cases (Real-World & Patterns)
Which real-world tasks/modules use this DS?
What coding patterns (e.g., sliding window, BFS) rely on it?
Where have you seen it in real-life software systems?

⚠️ 4. Common Pitfalls (Mistakes & Bugs)
What common mistakes do devs make with it?
What edge cases often break implementations?
What should you be careful about during interviews?

⚙️ 5. Related Concepts (Connections)
What data structures are related or interchangeable?
When should you pick this over others?
Can this be built using another DS?
Any common hybrids involving this?

🔎 6. Behind the Scenes (Internals)
How is it implemented internally in Java?
How is resizing/memory allocation handled?
Is it backed by arrays, pointers, trees, or hashes?
Thread-safety or concurrency considerations?

💼 7. Interviews + Code Challenges
What are the most common interview problems using this?
Can you implement it from scratch?
Can it help you optimize brute-force solutions?
Do you know 3+ variations of interview questions for it?

🚀 8. Real Code & Mini Projects
Can you build a small project using it? (e.g., LRU Cache, Autocomplete)
Have you seen it in open-source projects?
Can you find a visual demo of it in action? (e.g., VisuAlgo)
