# ⚔️ Static vs Dynamic Data Structure

| 🔷 Feature      | 🧱 Static                               | 🌊 Dynamic                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 📦 Size         | **Fixed size** at the start             | **Size can grow/shrink** during program  |
| 🔄 Flexibility  | Less flexible                           | Very flexible                            |
| 🧠 Memory       | Allocated at compile time (before run)  | Allocated at runtime (while running)     |
| 🧰 Examples     | Arrays                                  | Linked List, Stack (with LL), HashMap    |
| 📉 Memory Waste | Kabhi kabhi unused space waste hota hai | Uses only what is needed                 |
| ⏱️ Speed        | Fast access (indexing)                  | Slower access (traverse karna padta hai) |
